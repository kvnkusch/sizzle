## TODOs

- Monorepo configuration
  - CI/CD (via Github Actions)
    - Deploy web + server, standalone run migrations?
    - nx-affected commands
  - Labeling of libs to control imports (e.g. server can't import client, but can import utils, which can't import anything else)
    - Wonder how tRPC will affect this
  - Custom generators
    - Server lib
    - Client lib
    - Utils / core lib
- Testing
  - Backend tests with database
    - Investigate simply using one database for running all tests???
    - docker-compose for running tests (aka spinning up database?)
- tRPC
  - Example of a protected route with narrowed context type (e.g. for an authenticated route)
  - Is trpc-client lib at all helpful?
- See if environment variable library is needed (e.g. for web and server?)
  - Really only useful if env variables need to be used in a lib, but cannot be / is cumbersome to pass from the app
